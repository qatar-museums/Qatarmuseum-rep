 INTRODUCTION
 ------------

Guzzle is the PHP framework of choice when it comes to dealing with HTTP
requests. It provides an API to create robust web service clients or HTTP
clients of any kind.

When doing web request as part of the normal user request response cycle, one
want to have a eye on the number and performance of those requests to maintain
acceptable performance of Drupal itself.

As Guzzle uses curl_multi_exec as a wrapper for all http requests, analyzer
tools like New Relic can not provide any insights on the individual requests.
This is where "Past Guzzle" comes in.

"Past Guzzle" provides adapters for the Guzzle log plugin allowing to log
requests events with the "Past" framework.

 FEATURES
 --------

* Provides an simple adapter class for the Guzzle log plugin creating a "Past"
  event per request.
* Provides a compact adapter class for the Guzzle Log plugin creating an
  aggregation of all requests in one single "Past" event.
* The compact adapter supports aggregation of requests statistics for all
  request logged in the "Past" event.
* Provides a helper function to create and get a configured Guzzle Log plugin
  singleton instance ready for use.
* Logs all requests headers and if present the request body.
* Logs all response headers and the response body.
* Logs statistics about the request.

 REQUIREMENTS
 ------------

"Past Guzzle" is submodule of "Past" and can only work if "Past" itself is
installed and correctly configured.

This module further relies on composer manager to get access to the Guzzle
library.

 INSTALLATION
 ------------

Installation is as simple as enabling this module. If "Past" was not installed
before hand, a "Past" backend must be installed too. A good start would be the
"Past Database Backend"

Enabling "Past Guzzle" will not automatically log all requests done with a
guzzle client. Logging must be explicitly enabled. See section Usage below.

 USAGE
 -----

For simple logging with one "Past" event per request:

    // Ensure Drupal can auto load teh Guzzle classes.
    // In this example using composer manager.
    composer_manager_register_autoloader();
    $log_plugin = past_guzzle_plugin();
    $client = new \Guzzle\Http\Client('http://example.com');
    $client->addSubscriber($log_plugin);
    $response = $client->get('api/foo')->send()

Or an aggregation of all requests in one single "Past" event:

    // Ensure Drupal can auto load teh Guzzle classes.
    // In this example using composer manager.
    composer_manager_register_autoloader();
    $log_plugin = past_guzzle_plugin(PAST_GUZZLE_COMPACT);
    $client = new \Guzzle\Http\Client('http://example.com');
    $client->addSubscriber($log_plugin);
    $response = $client->get('api/foo')->send()

 KNOWN ISSUES
 ------------

The log adapter does not yet take care of sanitizing private data like e.g.
access tokens in requests headers. This is subject for a future release. Stay
tuned. See the issue queue for more.
